# Rock, Paper, Scissors, and more!

This is the classic game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" created in Python3. It is played following the rules explained on this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). Please report any bugs or suggest new features to [willhite.jerimiah@gmail.com](mailto:willhite.jerimiah@gmail.com).

## Features
- A leaderboard!
- An "enhanced" version that is unlocked after reaching 3 points!
- Colors!
- Logging of user input!

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3.7+, and should be compatible with 3.6+, but has only
been tested 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

## Running the Package
This program is meant to be run as a package. 
From the root directory (the same directory that this README is in), run the following:
```
python -m app
```
The game should start to run right away. Simply follow the prompts and you'll be playing in no time!

## Roadmap
Future features I'd like to add include:
- User registration/logging in to save scores/create profile to track data
- Player vs. Player battles
- Models trained on user behavior
- Online matchmaking

## Feedback
Any feedback for this program is welcome! This was a lot of fun to build, and a nice break from the more traditional interview tasks.
